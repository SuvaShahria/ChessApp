## Technologies

### Front End
* We used **Angular**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **TypeScript** to generate the frontend of the application.
* We implemented **chess.js API** and **chessboard.js API** for the chess logic and chessboard graphics. 

### Back End
* We used **SpringMVC** to leverage the Dispatcher-Servlet to create a FrontController design pattern to communicate with the backend.
* The backend system uses **SpringMVC** to connect to an **AWS RDS Postgres database**. 
* The front-end view uses **HTML/JavaScript** to make an application that can call server-side components. 
* Passwords are encrypted in **Java** and securely stored in the database. 
* The middle tier follows proper layered architecture and has reasonable (~70%) test coverage of the service layer. 

### Misc
* **GitHub** and **GitBash** for version control
* **Slack**, **Zoom**, and **Discord** for team communication and stand-up meetings
* We utilized scrum agile development framework

# Project-2 Requirements
Within groups of 4 or 5, you are required to develop an application using the following mandatory technologies.
#### Presentation Date: Friday Dec. 18th, 2020
You will present this application as if you were pitching it to a board or to investors.
When you're presenting, you're welcome to provide a brief slideshow demonstrating the technologies involved in the app, it's features, and the Agile Development Process you undewent to develop it.

## Required Technologies
- Spring MVC
- Angular
- Amazon RDS
- Hibernate
- GitHub (*Each team must maintain a repository to which all members contribute*)
- Unit Tests

## Required User Stories
- Login/Logout
- Register
- Anything else

## Agile Scrum Guidelines
For software teams, the stand-up is like the team’s huddle. It’s even commonly known as the daily scrum, and reinforces “we” to keep everyone aware of the team’s landscape and progress.
- Every morning, at 10:00am you will have a Daily Standup of about 7-10 minutes.
- At the end, each **Scrum Master** will report to the Trainer (Sophia) about the current status of the project and any blockers you're facing or have resolved
### In your Team Standups Use the 3 question agenda:
*Scrum Master asks each attendee to answer these questions.*
  1. *What have I done since the last meeting?*
  2. *What do I plan to complete before the next meeting*
  3. *What problems am I likely to face?*
*Don’t spend too much time on status updates. Focus on what needs to be done and the problems or impediments that may arise.*
> Of course, your team is responsible for holding additional planning and collaboration meetings -- stand-ups are simply a check-in.

## Suggestions:
- Use a [Kanban Board](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards) like [Trello](https://trello.com/?&aceid=&adposition=&adgroup=105703214328&campaign=9843285532&creative=437184392320&device=c&keyword=trello&matchtype=e&network=g&placement=&ds_kids=p53016490704&ds_e=GOOGLE&ds_eid=700000001557344&ds_e1=GOOGLE&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2af-BRDzARIsAIVQUOfgZifIwr-ClvNLXs4m9zn7VFhTU4bXoVdq1iBVe7SNfiXGeVVNKlgaAsHAEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
- Use a [Burndown Chart](http://www.agilenutshell.com/burndown)
- Present your app with a slide show and talk us through any extra technologies you implemented either within your application or to track the progress of your sprint.
